# Harold Pimentel's configuration files

The way this is set up is using GNU stow.
Each folder is a stow module.
Here's how you install them:

```
stow main
```

# installing the core

First, install Homebrew.
This is distributed via a Homebrew bundle.
Use this command to install:

  ```
     brew bundle
  ```


# vim

Make sure MacVim is installed via Homebrew.
Then, make sure you install `vim-plug`.
Startup vim, then run:

  ```
     :PlugInstall
  ```
